# Idea Scout Ledger

Gate-tracked backlog for dolphinRust. `idea-scout` writes **Build after X** candidates here as
`## DEFERRED` entries with a re-entry gate; `backlog-pipeline` reads them, evaluates the gate, and
on a successful PR moves the entry to `## SHIPPED`. Items approved for immediate build live on
GitHub as issues labeled `backlog-ready` instead — not here.

This ledger is only for items that genuinely need gate-tracking (uncertain evidence, a blocking
prior phase, an upstream product). It is not a general TODO list — PLAYBOOK.md owns the phase
roadmap, and memory owns milestones/deferrals.

Entry format:

```
### D{n} — {short title}
- **Source**: {competitive / ecosystem / inbound issue #}
- **Issue**: #{n}  (enhancement-labeled, NOT yet backlog-ready)
- **Re-entry gate**: {the "X" — a verifiable-now check or an external/human condition}
- **Design sketch**: {one or two lines, or a md/design/ path}
- **Added**: {date} by {manual | scheduled scout run}
```

## DEFERRED
